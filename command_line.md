## Notes on Command Line

[Ryan's Tutorial: Learning Linux](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/navigation.php)

_**'pwd'**_ =  Print Working Directory  
_**'~'**_ = _'tilde'_ is referencing it back to your home directory    
     _For example LeeRyans-MacBook-Pro:leeryansolomon = ~/Documents (where Documents is under the home directory)_  
_**'.'**_ = Reference to your current driectory that you are in e.g. ./Documents. This helps in looking at other directories without going into them  
_**'..'**_ = Reference to your parent directory. Can be used several times in a path to keep going up a directory  
_**'ls'**_ = Short list of all the files in the directory  
_**'ls -l'**_ = Long list of all the files in the directory  
_**'ls -a**_ = List all the hidden files too. Any files starting with a dot in front of it is a hidden file. 
_**'cd /'**_ = Moves to the main directory  
_**'Use single quotes ('') when trying to call a file with a name that has spaces. You can alos use the backslash (\) too**_  
_**'man'**_ = provides manual pages for the command to lookup. Press **'q'** to quit  
_**'man -k**_ = provides a key word search instead of user type the exact command. press **'n'** to find the next found item  
_**'mkdir'**_ = short for Make Directory
_**'mkdir -p'**_ = to make parent directories as needed
_**'mkdir -v'**_ = makes directory and tells us what it is doing  
_**'CHMOD 755'**_ = helps open a file if permissions are not allowed  
_**'touch'**_ = creates an  empty file  
**NOTE:** Using the **'-r'** option, which stands for recursive, we may copy directories. Recursive means that we want to look at a directory and all files and directories within it, and for subdirectories, go into them and do the same thing and keep doing this  
_**'cp'**_ = stands for copy  
_**'mv'**_ = moves files from one directory to another  
_**'rm'**_ = removes file from directory  
_**'rmdir'**_ = removes directory
